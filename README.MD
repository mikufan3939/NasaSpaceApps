# Rural View

## High-Level Summary
Rural View is a prototype web application that empowers agricultors, mainly those with small to medium sized properties, with access to NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) data. This data allows the farmers to take better informed decisions, like when to irrigate their crops or when to be on high alert about the crop health, which in turn helps them save resources, be it water or money.

## Project Details
Rural View is a prototype web application, developed using Python with Flask, which can be accessed with both mobile devices and computers. It allows the user to choose an area on a map, then it returns an image of the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) indices of the area. It works by requesting data from the Sentinel-2 sattelite via the Sentinel Hub API. Rural View benefits small to medium sized rural producers, empowering them with an easy way to access hard to visualize data, helping them with decision making regarding their crops. With this, we hope to achieve the improvement of resource management and decision making of local farmers.

### Use of Artificial Intelligence
We used Chat GPT, to help with the idealization of the project, the coding and the pitch.
